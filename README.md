# howis

Everybody asks `whereis` the application, but nobody asks `howis` the application.

This is a simple application based on the [Nobody asks "How is X?"](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nobody-asks-how-is-x) meme.
On most Linux (and possibly other Unix-like OSes), there is a utility called `whereis`, which finds the path to an executable contained in `PATH`.
